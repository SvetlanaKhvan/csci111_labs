    <p style="color: black; font-size:24px"> The town of Perovsk (Перо́вск) in Russian Turkestan later developed around the fort. <br>
      In 1925, the city was renamed Kzyl-Orda (Кзыл-Орда) and was designated as the capital of the Kazak ASSR. <br>
      The name literally means a red city, from the Turkic "кзыл" (red; used here in the common Soviet ideological connotation) and the Turkic Mongolian "орда" (city). <br>
      In 1927 the capital was relocated to the southeastern region and Alma-Ata. <br>

    <p style="color: black; font-size:24px"> Korkyt Ata Memorial, founded in 1980, is located beside Korkyt railroad station, near the village of Josaly, Kyzylorda Province. The complex was erected in this place for a reason: here, on the bank of the Syrdarya River, Korkyt, a famous Turkic poet and composer, was born. <br>
The monument consists of four vertical steles, made of reinforced concrete. Its height reaches 8 meters (26 ft). Each stela faces a different cardianl point.   Its decorated with “Tuye Taban” ornament, which translated from Kazakh means “camel's footprint”. It sympolyzes the magical camel, allegedly belonging to Korkyt Ata. <br>

This place is especially attractive for those interested in Kazakh national music, because Korkyt Ata left many works that have become an invaluable musical heritage of Kazakhstan. <br>
